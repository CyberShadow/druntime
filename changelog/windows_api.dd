Some $(D core.sys.windows) modules are now usable on POSIX

The Windows API bindings in Druntime contain declarations which are useful on other platforms.
This includes struct and enum declarations which describe file formats,
such as BMP (Windows Bitmap, an image format)
and PE (Portable Executable, used in .NET / CLR, UEFI, and other applications).

Previously, the contents of the Windows API bindings were not usable on other platforms
due to a `version (Windows):` guard at the top of each file.
This has now been removed for the following modules, making the declarations available on all platforms:

$(UL
$(LI $(MREF core,sys,windows,basetsd))
$(LI $(MREF core,sys,windows,basetyps))
$(LI $(MREF core,sys,windows,w32api))
$(LI $(MREF core,sys,windows,winbase))
$(LI $(MREF core,sys,windows,windef))
$(LI $(MREF core,sys,windows,wingdi))
$(LI $(MREF core,sys,windows,winnt))
$(LI $(MREF core,sys,windows,winuser))
$(LI $(MREF core,sys,windows,winver))
)
